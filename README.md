## Abstract
This repository will contain our work for the SOEN-499 project.
 Our project consists of a data-set analysis on the past weather,
 seasonal, pesticide, tourism, and forest industry's impact to the
 frequency and severity of forest fires in Canada. Our data-set will
 be drawn from the Canadian National Resource database. The
 primary data-sets will be the location, severity of forest fires in
 Canada, daily campsite visits, past weather, forestry data
 including lumbering and pesticide use. Our prediction is: that the
 increase use of pesticide, lack of precipitations, increase of
 campsite usage, and increase in lumber harvesting will contribute
 on their own to the occurrence and intensity of forest fires.
